# band-aid
BandAid is a unique take on the popular website BandCamp built using React/Redux front end technologies with an Express server backend.  It will allow users to sign up as an artist and upload music to be streamed onsite.  

BandAid is hosted on Heroku at https://band-aid-react.herokuapp.com/  

For development, please clone the Git repo.  Then cd into the project folder and npm install.  Please use the example.env file as a guide for creating your own local .env file.
